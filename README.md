### Fizzbuzz Pair Programming Task

The aim of this project was to introduce us to the concept of Test Driven Development by building some simple tests using RSpec.
We built a simple version of the Fizzbuzz game to use for the tests.

## How to use

```
shell require lib/fizzbuzz
shell fizzbuzz 3 (example)

You can also run this program for a range of numbers.

for i in (1..100) 
  puts fizzbuzz i
end
